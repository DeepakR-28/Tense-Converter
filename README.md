# Issues
This is not particularly an issue, maybe a bad practice or method. 
The file bundle.js was created because I was not able to use the "require" keyword in my script, in order to use "Compromise", hence I did some googling, and used browserify, it created a file with 15k lines of code, which had basically every function of compromise I guess, hence, I am wondering if there is a better way to solve that "require" problem, instead of bundling a file with 15k lines of code.  :)) hope I explained it well?
